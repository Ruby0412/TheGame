You just woke up to the sound of the news on the TV: "... have broken out of their quarantined area.  All individuals in charge of maintaining the area safe have also been infested.  These zombies will attack on sight.  We advise that you make your way to the safe zone immediately!  we repeat ... ".  Your worst nightmare has come true.  You knew you should have moved when they put the quarantine camp downtown.  Time to get a move on!
You made it to the safezone.  Immediately you spot the love of your life, looking for you.  You decide that you'll help humanity recover, and do what you love along the way.  Life is too short to do anything else.  Now to learn a whole lot of survival skills ...

		After a quick survey and creation of a mental map of the gasstation, you turn it on.  Fog everywhere; no zombies can see you anymore.  Now you can use your mental map to go to where you need.

A random zombie ran into you and grabbed your hand, and by the time you wrestled free, he had the keys.  Good thing these things don't know how to drive.

Seems like these zombies are already adapted to the lilac smell.  If the zombies see you outside of your car, they'll attack you.  Are you crazy?!?
